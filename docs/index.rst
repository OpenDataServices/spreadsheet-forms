Spreadsheet Forms
=================

Spreadsheet Forms is a Python library for working with data in JSON format from forms contained in spreadsheets.

It includes functions to:

* Create a blank spreadsheet form for collecting data
* Populate a spreadsheet form with existing data for review
* Extract JSON data from a spreadsheet form for storage and processing

The above functions require a guide form spreadsheet that specifies the structure of the form.

There can be several functions to achieve the same thing, based on what level of performance you need.
