Spreadsheet Forms
=================

Spreadsheet Forms is a Python library for working with data in JSON format from forms contained in spreadsheets.

If you create a form in a spreadsheet, it is easy to send to other people and ask them to fill it in and send it back to you. This library makes it easier to create and process those forms.

It includes functions to:

* Create a blank spreadsheet form for collecting data
* Populate a spreadsheet form with existing data for review
* Extract JSON data from a spreadsheet form for storage and processing

The above functions require a guide form spreadsheet that specifies the structure of the form.

There can be several functions to achieve the same thing, based on what level of performance you need.
