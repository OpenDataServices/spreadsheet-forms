Spreadsheet Forms
=================

You want to create a form in a spreadsheet. You want to send this to people who will fill in the data.
You want to then get the forms back and automatically extract the data from them for you to process.
Also, maybe you want to take some existing data and put it into a spreadsheet form to send to someone to check.
