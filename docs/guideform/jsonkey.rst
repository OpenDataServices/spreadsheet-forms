JSON Keys
=========

In the guideform, you can set JSON Keys at various points.

These set the point in the data that values will be read or written to.

These can be single keys:

Eg:

* `pet`

These can also be several keys split by a slash. In this case, it will traverse down several dictionaries.

Eg:

* `pet/kind`
